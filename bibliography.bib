  abstract = {In many data-driven machine learning problems it is useful to consider the data as generated from a set of unknown (latent) generators or sources. The observations we make are then taken to be related to these sources through some unknown functionaility. Furthermore, the (unknown) number of underlying latent sources may be different to the number of observations and hence issues of model complexity plague the analysis. Recent developments in Independent Component Analysis (ICA) have shown that, in the case where the unknown function linking sources to observations is linear, data decomposition may be achieved in a mathematically elegant manner. In this paper we extend the general ICA paradigm to include a very flexible source model and prior constraints and argue that for particular biomedical signal processing problems (we consider EEG analysis) we require the constraint of positivity in the mixing process.},

  abstract = {The horseshoe prior has proven to be a noteworthy alternative for sparse Bayesian estimation, but has previously suffered from two problems. First, there has been no systematic way of specifying a prior for the global shrinkage hyperparameter based on the prior information about the degree of sparsity in the parameter vector. Second, the horseshoe prior has the undesired property that there is no possibility of specifying separately information about sparsity and the amount of regularization for the largest coefficients, which can be problematic with weakly identified parameters, such as the logistic regression coefficients in the case of data separation. This paper proposes solutions to both of these problems. We introduce a concept of effective number of nonzero parameters, show an intuitive way of formulating the prior for the global hyperparameter based on the sparsity assumptions, and argue that the previous default choices are dubious based on their tendency to favor solutions with more unshrunk parameters than we typically expect a priori. Moreover, we introduce a generalization to the horseshoe prior, called the regularized horseshoe, that allows us to specify a minimum level of regularization to the largest values. We show that the new prior can be considered as the continuous counterpart of the spike-and-slab prior with a finite slab width, whereas the original horseshoe resembles the spike-and-slab with an infinitely wide slab. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real world data illustrate the benefit of both of these theoretical advances.},

  abstract = {Achieving the predictable expression of heterologous genes in a production host has proven difficult. Each heterologous gene expressed in the same host seems to elicit a different host response governed by unknown mechanisms. Historically, most studies have approached this challenge by manipulating the properties of the heterologous gene through methods like codon optimization. Here we approach this challenge from the host side. We express a set of 45 heterologous genes in the same Escherichia coli strain, using the same expression system and culture conditions. We collect a comprehensive RNAseq set to characterize the host's transcriptional response. Independent Component Analysis of the RNAseq data set reveals independently modulated gene sets (iModulons) that characterize the host response to heterologous gene expression. We relate 55\% of variation of the host response to: Fear vs Greed (16.5\%), Metal Homeostasis (19.0\%), Respiration (6.0\%), Protein folding (4.5\%), and Amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis (9.0\%). If these responses can be controlled, then the success rate with predicting heterologous gene expression should increase.},

  abstract = {A fundamental problem in neural network research, as well as in many other disciplines, is finding a suitable representation of multivariate data, i.e. random vectors. For reasons of computational and conceptual simplicity, the representation is often sought as a linear transformation of the original data. In other words, each component of the representation is a linear combination of the original variables. Well-known linear transformation methods include principal component analysis, factor analysis, and projection pursuit. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a recently developed method in which the goal is to find a linear representation of non-Gaussian data so that the components are statistically independent, or as independent as possible. Such a representation seems to capture the essential structure of the data in many applications, including feature extraction and signal separation. In this paper, we present the basic theory and applications of ICA, and our recent work on the subject.},

  abstract = {In recent years, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful technology for transcriptome profiling. For a given gene, the number of mapped reads is not only dependent on its expression level and gene length, but also the sequencing depth. To normalize these dependencies, RPKM (reads per kilobase of transcript per million reads mapped) and TPM (transcripts per million) are used to measure gene or transcript expression levels. A common misconception is that RPKM and TPM values are already normalized, and thus should be comparable across samples or RNA-seq projects. However, RPKM and TPM represent the relative abundance of a transcript among a population of sequenced transcripts, and therefore depend on the composition of the RNA population in a sample. Quite often, it is reasonable to assume that total RNA concentration and distributions are very close across compared samples. Nevertheless, the sequenced RNA repertoires may differ significantly under different experimental conditions and/or across sequencing protocols; thus, the proportion of gene expression is not directly comparable in such cases. In this review, we illustrate typical scenarios in which RPKM and TPM are misused, unintentionally, and hope to raise scientists' awareness of this issue when comparing them across samples or different sequencing protocols.},

To bypass many of the well-established challenges of simulating from the distribution of a random orthogonal matrix \$\textbackslash boldsymbol\{Q\},\$ we construct a distribution for an unconstrained random matrix \$\textbackslash boldsymbol\{X\}\$ such that \$\textbackslash boldsymbol\{Q\}\_X,\$ the orthogonal component of the polar decomposition of \$\textbackslash boldsymbol\{X\},\$ is equal in distribution to \$\textbackslash boldsymbol\{Q\}.\$ The distribution of \$\textbackslash boldsymbol\{X\}\$ is amenable to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation using standard methods, and an approximation to the distribution of \$\textbackslash boldsymbol\{Q\}\$ can be recovered from a Markov chain on the unconstrained space. When combined with modern MCMC software, polar expansion allows for routine and flexible posterior inference in models with orthogonal matrix parameters. We find that polar expansion with adaptive Hamiltonian Monte Carlo is an order of magnitude more efficient than competing MCMC approaches in a benchmark protein interaction network application. We also propose a new approach to Bayesian functional principal components analysis which we illustrate in a meteorological time series application.},

	abstract = {Half a century has passed since the discovery of operons (groups
	            of genes that are transcribed together as a single mRNA). Despite
	            the importance of operons in bacterial gene networks, the
	            relationship between their organization and gene expression
	            remains poorly understood. Here we show using synthetic operons
	            in Escherichia coli that the expression of a given gene increases
	            with the length of the operon and as its position moves farther
	            from the end of the operon. These findings can be explained by a
	            common mechanism; increasing the distance from the start of a
	            gene to the end of the operon (termed the ``transcription
	            distance'') provides more time for translation to occur during
	            transcription, resulting in increased expression. We confirmed
	            experimentally that the increased expression is indeed due to
	            increased translation. Furthermore our analysis indicates the
	            translation initiation rate for an mRNA is sixfold greater during
	            transcription than after its release, which amplifies the impact
	            of the transcription distance on gene expression. As a result of
	            these mechanisms, gene expression increases by {$\sim$}40\% for
	            each 1,000 nucleotides of transcription distance. In summary, we
	            demonstrate that a fundamental relationship exists between gene
	            expression and the number, length, and order of the genes in an
	            operon. This relationship has important implications for
	            understanding the functional basis of genome organization and

A useful description of the TRN would decompose the transcriptome into targeted effects of individual transcriptional regulators. Here, we apply unsupervised machine learning to a diverse compendium of over 250 high-quality Escherichia coli RNA-seq datasets to identify 92 statistically independent signals that modulate the expression of specific gene sets. We show that 61 of these transcriptomic signals represent the effects of currently characterized transcriptional regulators. Condition-specific activation of signals is validated by exposure of E. coli to new environmental conditions. The resulting decomposition of the transcriptome provides: a mechanistic, systems-level, network-based explanation of responses to environmental and genetic perturbations; a guide to gene and regulator function discovery; and a basis for characterizing transcriptomic differences in multiple strains. Taken together, our results show that signal summation describes the composition of a model prokaryotic transcriptome.},
